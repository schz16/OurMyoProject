# Introduce the problem and specify the motivations  
problem: difficulty detecting onset of heart attack 
motivations: can save lives 

Myocardial Infarction (MI) is a tricky disease that is highly prevalent in all countries. The way it affects the individual, presents itself, and the time at which it occurs differs in virtually every patient. Many individuals die from acute MI before ever arriving at the hospital, some have complications and some do not, and some complications worsen the condition and some do not. All of these factors make MI one of the most challenging obstacles of modern medicine, and thus any sort of indication of onset of the disease would benefit the medical community greatly. This dataset contains information that can help predict onset, which will help identify MI in future patients. This information could save millions of lives that are currently at great risk.
