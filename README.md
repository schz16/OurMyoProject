## Description: 
Myocardial Infarction (MI) is a tricky disease that is highly prevalent in all countries. The way it affects the individual, presents itself, and the time at which it occurs differs in virtually every patient. Many individuals die from acute MI before ever arriving at the hospital, some have complications and some do not, and some complications worsen the condition and some do not. All of these factors make MI one of the most challenging obstacles of modern medicine, and thus any sort of indication of onset of disease would benefit the medical community greatly. This dataset contains information that can be helped to predict onset, which will help identify it in future patients. This information could save millions of lives that are currently at great risk.  
## Goals: 
Based on patient data from the day they were admitted and the third day in care, we hope to predict myocardial infarction complications. Specifically, complications can be predicted during four different time periods; time of admission, end of the first day, end of the second day, and end of the third day. Further, this information can be used in phenotyping of disease (cluster analysis), dynamic phenotyping (filament extraction and identification of disease trajectories) and visualisation (disease mapping).

## Info about data: 
This data includes 124 columns detailing either patient information or possible complications. Column 1 includes a numeric patient identifier, 2-112 include patient information, and 113-124 include possible complications. Upon importing the data set, the columns are abbreviated by “V1, V2, V3… etc.,” as the actual column names are incredibly lengthy.
